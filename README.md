**Core Focuses of the Project (as well as features i want to add):**

1. Well-written debugger with lots of interactive parts as well
2. As accurate as I can make it
3. Optimized where possible
4. reduce lines in each opcode function (pretty much optimizing)
5. calling conditions instead of branching
6. use sdl
7. emulate ppu delays/timings correctly
8. pixel fifo
9. video recording, screenshots
10. rewind and savestates
11. zip file opening
