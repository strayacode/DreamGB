# DreamGB
A gameboy emulator to be commenced later...

**Core Focuses of the Project:**

1. Well-written debugger with lots of interactive parts as well
2. As accurate as I can make it
3. Optimized where possible
4. reduce lines in each opcode function (pretty much optimizing)
5. calling conditions instead of branching
